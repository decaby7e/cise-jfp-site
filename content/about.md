My name is Jack Polk and I am currently a computer science student at the University of Florida. I work at the CISE department and I intend for this website to be a hub for
various projects and announcements that may be made in relation to my work in the department. If you have any questions, feel free to drop by the office @ E314 or drop me an
email at jack dot polk at ufl dot edu.
